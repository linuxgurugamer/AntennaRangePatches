Configured for KSP 1.0.4 and AutoPruner v1.1 (2015/7/24)
===========================================================================================
How to use:
1. Unzip contents to a desired folder
2. Copy all .prnl files of your choice to AutoPruner/PRNLs
3. Specify the newly copied file from AutoPruner's interface
4. PROFIT!!! :D

To check the contents of .prnl files, just open it using any text editor of your choice (ex. Notepad).
I reccomend using Notepad++ for the purpose.
===========================================================================================

KW SRB list prunes all KW solid rocket boosters except the ullage motor.

Modified Stock Wings list prunes all Structural Wings, Wing Connectors, and Tail Fins, along with elevons. Tail Connectors not included.
I have excluded shuttle wing parts here. Use Stock_ShuttleWings if you want to prune those also.

Modified Stock Tanks list contains a fix to include Kerbodine tanks in the list again. Now includes small and large Ore Tanks also.

Modified RO Global Tanks list contains a fix to include NearFuture Argon/Hydrogen/Xenon tanks, and Kerbodine tanks again. Also includes TaurusHCV/RSCapsuledyne fuel tanks and ore tanks now.

Modified RO Global Fairings list contains a fix to include stock fairings now.

Stock Fairings and HeatShield lists each prune what the name states.

ExtraplanetaryLaunchpad UKS integration list prunes all parts from EXL excluding the SurvayStake and the Mallet, which are redundant when used with UKS.

Please post here if you find anything left out, or you want something else added to the list!
Also if you make your own prune lists, it would help to post it there also so I can pick it up and add it in :)

(To make one yourself, find the folder you want to prune, open a text editor and write down the folder path below GameData, then save the file as [NameHere].prnl)


Alternatively, post in the AutoPruner main thread linked below.
